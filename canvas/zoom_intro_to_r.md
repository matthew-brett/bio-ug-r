This page is for the Zoom session introducing R.

You can find the video for that session in [this link](https://bham.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=8db04b99-c32c-45a6-851b-ac4d0128a631)

The slide handout is here.

You'll see this in the slide handout, but the link to the example exercise
there is
<https://uobhub.org/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmatthew-brett%2Fclear-easy&urlpath=/rstudio>

As you'll see in the video, or as you'll know if you were in the session, the link takes you to the R in the cloud system, where you should be able to play with the R notebook in your web browser.

The system locked up during the session, because there were so many of you using the system at the same time.

If you aren't all using the system at the same time, I think you'll find the
system, and the link above, will work fine, but please email me at
<m.brett@bham.ac.uk> if that is not true.

I've also been working on the system to make it work better with all of you
using it at the same time, so the next time we have a session, it should work.
