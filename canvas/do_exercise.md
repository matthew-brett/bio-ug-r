You should do your exercises in the [Python / Jupyter cloud
system](python-slash-jupyter-in-the-cloud).

Click the exercise / homework link to go to the exercise.

When you click on the exercise / homework link, the cloud system will fetch
the files you need, and it will open the notebook in your browser.

Now fill in the notebook, following the instructions in the notebook.

When you have finished, don't forget to save the notebook file:
