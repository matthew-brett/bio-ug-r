This is your first introduction to using R, using the online Datacamp tutorial
system.

Follow this tutorial - [R from
scratch](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/r-from-scratch).  It covers the
material you need to fill in your first notebook - see below.  You will need
to make a free DataCamp account to do the tutorial, but **the R from scratch
course is completely free** (see below).

If you don't understand anything, please do post on Discussions here on
campus, or email <m.brett@bham.ac.uk>.

At various points, DataCamp will put up splash screen asking you to "Upgrade
your account to continue" with "Full access to all courses". Just press Escape
(the Esc key) to continue without upgrade. You do not need to upgrade to do
this course.

**Be careful** - the *completely free* "R from scratch" course sends
you off to do a section from the *not free* course called (oddly) "Free
introduction to R".  Because that course is not free, when you get to
the end of the first section, and try to go on to the next section,
DataCamp will try and force you to pay. **You do not have to pay**.
To avoid this, stop when you've finished the last page of the free
section, called "What's that data type", and come back to the
"Variables interlude" page of the "R from scratch" course, and continue from
there.

See [this video](https://vimeo.com/370870798)for an explanation, if you
get stuck.
