This is another interactive R tutorial.

This tutorial builds on the stuff you covered in the [first Datacamp
tutorial](datacamp-introduction-to-r).

The second tutorial is
<https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/statistical-inference-and-data-analysis>

You need the first two chapters, which are:

* Introduction to R (this will give you some revision, and some new features);
* Introduction to Data.

Stop after that - unless you want to continue. The further stuff is more
advanced.

## Please read before you do the tutorial

There are a few places in the tutorial where it's hard to see what to do, or
easy to make mistakes.  Please read this section now so you recognize the
problem and know to come back here for the fix.

For the second section in the first chapter, "Introduction to R", you need:

```
present <- read.table('http://assets.datacamp.com/course/dasi/present.txt')
```

You'll see what we mean.

A little later on, you will see this sentence in an exercise: '... we could
add a third argument: `type = "l"` (with `l` being short for line).'  **That's
a small L, not the digit 1, beware**.

For the first section in the second chapter, "Introduction to Data", the
command you need to type is:

```
load(url('http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/course/dasi/cdc.Rdata'))
```

You'll see where that goes, when you get there.

Don't rush, go at the right speed for you to understand what you are doing.
The important thing is that you fully understand the exercises and solutions.

See [Datacamp introduction to R](datacamp-introduction-to-r) for instructions
on various things, including getting an account on DataCamp, staying with the
default free account, and the FAQ, for when you run into problems.

Please do ask for help if you have any problems. Try the Discussions here or
