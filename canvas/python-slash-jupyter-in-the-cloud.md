We have set up a system that allows you to use Python and Jupyter, from your web browser.

We do highly recommend you [install Python / Jupyter on your
computer](https://matthew-brett.github.io/cfd2020/intro/the_software.html) but
you don't need to do that to do the workshops or homework.

## Using the cloud system

Point your browser to <https://uobhub.org>

You should see this:

Click on that button to get:

Click "Log On", then enter your University email address:

Click "Next" and enter your University password at the following screen.

At the screen after that (below), you can click "Yes" if you are on
your own computer and you want to stay signed in, for convenience.
"No" will also work, it's just you will have to sign in more often.

The first time you log in, you should get an initial screen like this:

If you want to create a new Python Jupyter Notebook, go to the "New" dropdown
menu at the right, near the top, and select "Python 3":
