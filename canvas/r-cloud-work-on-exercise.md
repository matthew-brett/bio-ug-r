You can do your exercises in the [R in the cloud](R in the cloud) system, or
on your own laptop, if you [install R on your
computer](installing-r-on-your-computer).

This page is about how to do the exercises in the R in the cloud system.

Click the exercise / homework link to go to the exercise.

When you click on the exercise / homework link, the cloud system will fetch
the files you need, and it will open the cloud system in your browser.

Please see the "System can be slow to start" section of the [R in the cloud](R in the cloud) system page.

The cloud system should (eventually) open directly in RStudio, in which case
your browser tab will look something like this (depending on where you left
RStudio last time):

Now you have RStudio open, use the File - Open File... menu option in RStudio
to navigate to the file or directory for the exercise or homework.  See your
instructions for the homework or exercise for the file you should work on.

## Example of opening a file in RStudio

For example, imagine the instructions say you should be working on the `bio240_hw1.Rmd` file in the `r-data-hw01` directory.  To get to that file, you would use the File menu on R Studio ...

... to navigate to the `r-data-hw01` directory:

![](../file_contents/course%20files/images/rstudio_data_hw01.png)

Then you would open the `bio240_hw01.Rmd` file:

![](../file_contents/course%20files/images/rstudio_hw01_file.png)

See the instructions for the homework or exercise, for what to do next.

## Saving your work

When you have finished, don't forget to save the file(s) you have been working on.
