You should do your exercises in the [R in the cloud](R in the cloud) system.

Click the exercise / homework link to go to the exercise.

When you click on the exercise / homework link, the cloud system will fetch
the files you need, and it will open the cloud system in your browser.

Depending on the link, the cloud system may open directly in RStudio, in which case your browser tab will look something like this (depending on where you left RStudio last time):

The system may also open in the basic "JupyterHub" interface.  The JupyterHub
interface looks something like this:

If the system opens in the JupyterHub interface, then open RStudio from the "New" dropdown menu near the top right of the JupyterHub interface:

Now you have RStudio open, use the File menu in RStudio to navigate to the file or directory for the exercise or homework.  See your instructions for the homework or exercise for the file you should work on.

## Example of opening a file in RStudio

For example, imagine the instructions say you should be working on the `bio240_hw1.Rmd` file in the `r-data-hw01` directory.  To get to that file, you would use the File menu on R Studio ...

![](../file_contents/course%20files/images/rstudio_file_open.png)

... to navigate to the `r-data-hw01` directory:

![](../file_contents/course%20files/images/rstudio_data_hw01.png)

Then you would open the `bio240_hw01.Rmd` file:

![](../file_contents/course%20files/images/rstudio_hw01_file.png)

See the instructions for the homework or exercise, for what to do next.

## Saving your work

When you have finished, don't forget to save the file(s) you have been working on.

## If you are submitting homework

If you are submitting this file, then [download the file from R cloud](Download from R cloud), and submit the downloaded file via Canvas.

Any problems, use the Discussion section on Canvas, or email
