The R and data analysis part of the course has one assessment at the
end.

The assessment will be an R notebooks for you to fill in. It is open-book,
you can search for answers on the web, but of course you can't share work with
other students doing the assessment - it must all be your own work.  We will
give you several days to fill in the notebook.

As you will see in the workshops, [R
notebooks](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/notebook.html) are documents
that mix text, such as descriptions of what the data means, and the processing
you want to do, with short fragments of code, called chunks.

The assignments are documents like these, that contain instructions
about what to do, and some template code chunks for you to complete, to do the
analysis.

You can get some practice on these in the optional Zoom session(s).
