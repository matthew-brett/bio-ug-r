We have set up a system that allows you to use R from your web-browser,
without installing anything on your computer.

We do highly recommend you [install R on our
computer](installing-r-on-your-computer "Installing R on your computer"), but
you don't need to do that to do the workshops or homework.

## Using the cloud system

Point your browser to <https://uobhub.org>

You should see this:

Click on that button to get:

![](../file_contents/course%20files/images/cilogon_first.png)

Click "Log On", then enter your University email address:

![](../file_contents/course%20files/images/uob_sign_in.png)

Click "Next" and enter your University password at the following screen.

At the screen after that (below), you can click "Yes" if you are on
your own computer and you want to stay signed in, for convenience.
"No" will also work, it's just you will have to sign in more often.

You should then get the option to choose between an "R environment" and a
"Python for science" environment. You are learning R, so choose the R
environment.

Please make sure *not* to chose the Python option; this is for another set of
classes.

You should end up with the R Studio page in the browser, like this:

If you accidentally selected the "Python for science" option above, see
[switching from Python to R](Switching from Python to R) to fix this.

## The system can be slow to start

If you are unlucky, or there are many people using the system at the same
time, the system may be slow to start.  You may see errors like "could not
start rstudio in time" or "service unavailable". If so, try refreshing the
page in your browser.  Keep trying for a few minutes if that does not work.

If it still does not work, contact <m.brett@bham.ac.uk> for help.
