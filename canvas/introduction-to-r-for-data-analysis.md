This module introduces you to the R language for statistics.  R is very
powerful environment and language for statistics and data analysis.  It is
widely used in research, and being able to use R is a skill that many employers
will value, in psychology and beyond.

R is very different from programs like Excel or SPSS - instead of clicking
around an interface, you do an R analysis by typing commands for R to execute.
This takes some getting used to, but it has several major advantages:

*   It is much easier to record what you did in your analysis in a way that you
    can check and repeat;  this makes it easier to avoid and to spot mistakes
    (see [Economists, an Excel error, and the misguided push for
    austerity](https://theconversation.com/economists*an-excel-error-and-the-misguided-push-for-austerity-13584)
    for one particularly scary example).
*   The underlying language gives you great power to adapt and extend your
    analysis to many different types of data and analysis.
*   You are using the same tools as a large community, including researchers
    who have special experience in statistics and data science, so it is easier
    to collaborate with them, and ask for advice;
*   For the same reason there is lots of high-quality help and support for
    using R online.

This module introduces you to the R way of doing things.

In case you were thinking about assessments already, you can leap across to [Assessment for R / data
analysis](assessment-for-r-slash-data-analysis). But we encourage you to stay
with; our desire is to help you to learn, where the assessments are as much to
help us understand what we've succeeded in teaching, as to test you.

## Plan of campaign

### Week 8

* [install R on your own
  computer](installing-r-on-your-computer)

### Week 9

* Zoom: Introduction to R and the R notebook
* Work through [Datacamp introduction tutorial for
  R](datacamp-introduction-to-r)

Don't forget to [install R on your own computer](installing-r-on-your-computer).

### Week 10

* Working with tables and columns of data; selecting and plotting data
* Work through [second Datacamp tutorial for R](second-datacamp-tutorial-for-r).

### Week 11

* Zoom: R packages.  Randomness simulations, and loops.
* Practice notebooks.

## Tools

R is completely free software ([free as in beer, and free as in
speech](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html)). We highly recommend you
[install it on your own
computer](installing-r-on-your-computer); it is very likely you will find
yourself using R to analyze your own data in due course.

For those of you who cannot install R, we have set up an [online system for you
to work with R](r-in-the-cloud). You can log into this system at any time at
<https://uobhub.org>.  Please note that this system can be slow to start when
many of you are using it at the same time, another reason to prefer [installing
R on your own computer](installing-r-on-your-computer). See the [R in the
cloud](r-in-the-cloud) page for more information.

## Frustration and support

We are always happy to hear from you if you are getting stuck or you have any
questions.

You will gradually discover that using R can be very rewarding, but it can also
be frustrating. [frustration is a good sign that you are
learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxwxefRAu70&feature=youtu.be&t=1803)

But - sometimes fruitful frustration becomes being stuck - and that
isn't helpful, is painful, and it wastes your time. So, please, if you're
stuck, let us know.  Post on the discussions here on Canvas, or email
<m.brett@bham.ac.uk>.
