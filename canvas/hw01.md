This exercise uses the R notebook.

See the [Zoom session on the
R notebook](../pages/zoom-session-introduction-to-r-notebook) page for more
details about how to use the R notebook.

You can do the exercise on your own computer, or on the [R in the
cloud](../pages/R in the cloud) system.

## On your own computer

First, [install R on your computer](../pages/installing-r-on-your-computer).

Next go to [this
link](https://github.com/matthew-brett/r-data-hw01/archive/master.zip) to
download a Zip file with the exercise files.

*Unpack the Zip file* to some sensible place on your computer, such as your
Desktop.  *Please don't forget to unpack the zip file*.  This is especially
easy to forget on Windows.  On Windows, make sure, when you open the Zip file,
that you run "Extract All" on the Zip file to extract its contents, and you
then use the extracted files.

Open RStudio, and then use the File - Open File ... option to open the `bio240_hw1.Rmd` file.  This is an R notebook.

Fill in the notebook, following the instructions.

Use File - Save to save the notebook when you have finished.

Submit the saved `bio240_hw1.Rmd` file here on Canvas.

Read the instructions in the `bio240_hw1.Rmd` notebook and follow them, to fill
in the notebook.

When you have finished, don't forget to [save your
